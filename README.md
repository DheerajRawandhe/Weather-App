# Weather App in React

Weather App is built using React, with state management and API integration to fetch real-time weather data. i used Material UI for styling, making the UI modern and responsive.

(i) Users can enter a city name to get weather details.
(ii) Fetches live weather data from an external API.
(iii) Displays temperature, humidity, min/max temperature, and weather description.

This project improves React skills, API handling, and UI design. You can enhance it by adding location-based weather and animations.ðŸš€
